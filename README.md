# Ragdoll Factory
A tool to create ragdolls easily in Unity by clicking on the bones you want to have rigidbodies, joints and collisions.
You can build a complete ragdoll in under five minutes with this, useful if you use a lot of ragdolls and they also vary in shapes or anatomy.

### Made in Unity 2021.3.20f1 - Can't guarantee it works on older versions.
This version also seems to have a bug with the gizmos for colliders, so they might not appear in the scene view. They still work, though.

## Installation
* Make sure you already have the unity editor open.
* Download and **open** the .unitypackage file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Gann4Life/RagdollFactory/releases).
* A window will appear asking you to import the package, click on `Import`.

## Usage
1. Once imported, select your model.
2. Look for `Gann4Games` -> `Tools` -> `RagdollFactory` in the menu bar.
3. Begin creating with your preferred workflow.

You can delete the component once you're done, and add it again whenever you want to continue working on the ragdoll.

All tabs have three modes: `Create`, `Edit` and `Delete`. You can change between them with the buttons found in the inspector.

### Collision tabs (Capsule & Box)
* `Create` mode: Click on the bone you want to start creating a collider from, then click on the bone you want to end the collider in.
* `Edit` mode: Click on the collider you want to edit, then change the values you need from the inspector window.
* `Delete` mode: Click on the collider you want to delete.
### Configurable Joint tab
* `Create` mode: Click on the bone you want to start creating a joint from, then click on the bone you want to end the joint in. (The joint will be created on the second selected bone)
* `Edit` mode: Click on the joint you want to edit, then change the values you need from the inspector window.
* `Delete` mode: Click on the joint you want to delete.
### Rigidbodies tab
* `Create` mode: Click on the bone you want to create a rigidbody on.
* `Edit` mode: Click on the rigidbody you want to edit, then change the values you need from the inspector window.
* `Delete` mode: Click on the rigidbody you want to delete.
